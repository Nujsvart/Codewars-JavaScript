/* Create Phone Number

Write a function that accepts an array of 10 integers (between 0 and 9), that returns a string of those numbers in the form of a phone number.

Example:
createPhoneNumber([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]) // => returns "(123) 456-7890"
The returned format must be correct in order to complete this challenge.
Don't forget the space after the closing parentheses! */

function createPhoneNumber(numbers) {
  const first = numbers.splice(0, 3).join("").padStart(4, "(").padEnd(5, ")");
  const sec = numbers.splice(3, 0, "-");
  return `${first} ${numbers.join("")}`;
}

/* Who likes it ?

You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed next to such an item.

Implement a function likes :: [String] -> String, which must take in input array, containing the names of people who like an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples:

likes [] -- must be "no one likes this"
likes ["Peter"] -- must be "Peter likes this"
likes ["Jacob", "Alex"] -- must be "Jacob and Alex like this"
likes ["Max", "John", "Mark"] -- must be "Max, John and Mark like this"
likes ["Alex", "Jacob", "Mark", "Max"] -- must be "Alex, Jacob and 2 others like this"
For 4 or more names, the number in and 2 others simply increases. */

function likes(names) {
  if (!names.length) {
    return "no one likes this";
  } else if (names.length === 1) {

/* Convert string to camel case

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

Examples
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior" */

/* Multiples of 3 or 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.

Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

/* IQ Test

Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

Examples:
iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even

iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd */

  const odd = numbers
    .split(" ")
    .filter((num) => num % 2 !== 0)
    .join(" ");
  const even = numbers
    .split(" ")
    .filter((num) => num % 2 === 0)
    .join(" ");
  return [...odd].length < [...even].length
    ? numbers.split(" ").indexOf(odd) + 1
    : numbers.split(" ").indexOf(even) + 1;

/* Stop gninnipS My sdroW!

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (like the name of this kata).

Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces.
Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.
Examples:

spinWords("Hey fellow warriors") => "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords("This is a test") => "This is a test" 
spinWords("This is another test") => "This is rehtona test" */

const spinWords = (string) =>
  string
    .split(" ")
    .map((str) => (str.length >= 5 ? str.split("").reverse().join("") : str))
    .join(" ");
